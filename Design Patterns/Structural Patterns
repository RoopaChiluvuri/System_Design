Adapter Pattern
- The Adapter Pattern is a design pattern used to make two incompatible interfaces work together.
It acts as a bridge between two different classes, allowing them to communicate without changing their code.

Composite Pattern
- The Composite Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to treat a group of objects and a single object in the same way.
It is used when you want to represent a hierarchy of objects where:

Some objects are individual items (leaf nodes).
Others are composed of multiple items (composite nodes).
