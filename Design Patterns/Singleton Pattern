A singleton pattern is a way of designing a class so that:

 - Only one object (instance) of the class is created for the entire program.
- Everyone in the program uses that same object.

Think of it like:
A single TV remote that everyone in the room uses to control the TV. You don't want multiple remotes causing confusion!


The Enum Singleton pattern is the most robust and concise way to implement a singleton in Java.

public enum EnumSingleton {
    INSTANCE;

    public void doSomething() {
        // Add any singleton logic here
    }
}
