Factory Pattern

- The Factory Pattern is a design pattern used to create objects without specifying their exact class. 
Instead of creating objects directly using new, you let a factory (a special method or class) handle the creation for you.


Abstract Factory Pattern 

- The Abstract Factory Pattern is an advanced version of the Factory Pattern.
It provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their exact classes.
